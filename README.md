# Calgary Covid-19 Tracker
A choropleth and calendar visualization of projected active covid-19 cases in Calgary by community. The choropleth map shows projected active cases in each community for the most recent date collected in AHS' Alberta Covid-19 Statistics dataset. The calendar shows historical data for the total number of active cases in Calgary for the specific date.

## Disclaimer
The values recorded in the choropleth map visualization for active cases in each community **are not accurate** and are **projected cases**. These projected cases give insight on the possible case distribution among communities in their respective sector. The projected cases are calculated from each sector's active cases multiplied by a community's population percentage in its respective sector.

Real active cases are collected by the AHS based on the local geographic regions of Calgary or sectors. Information regarding the Official Standard Geographic Areas of Alberta used by the AHS can be found below.

Communities with 0 projected cases are communities that reported to have no residents according to the city of Calgary's 2019 Census by Community. More information about Calgary's community and population are listed below.
