# Calgary Covid-19 Tracker
A choropleth and calendar visualization of active covid-19 cases in Calgary by community. The choropleth map shows projected active cases in each community for the most recent date in the dataset. The calendar shows historical data for the total number of active cases in Calgary for the specific date.

## Data sets
Datasets for this visualization were collected from AHS https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#data-export and the City  of Calgary's Open Data Portal https://data.calgary.ca/Demographics/Census-by-Community-2019/rkfr-buzb.

## Disclaimer
The values recorded in the choropleth map visualization for active cases in each community are not accurate and are projected cases. Real active cases are collected by the local geographic region of Calgary or sectors. The projected cases are calculated from each sector's active cases multiplied by a community's population percentage in its respective sector.
